## üëÄ Watch the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/g_pkATT8pYU?si=8KwGSzJ_nxWHx-k3)

### üñ•Ô∏è [Live Demo](https://frames-gilt.vercel.app/basic)

Paste the live demo url into https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames to validate the frame.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ChangoMan/frames.git

# Enter the new directory
cd frames

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project (you can copy from `.env.example`) and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to your site's public URL:

If your website is not deployed, you may not have a public URL just yet.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For the basic frame example, go to [http://localhost:3000/basic](http://localhost:3000/basic)

For the advanced frame example, go to [http://localhost:3000/advanced](http://localhost:3000/advanced)

## Deployment

Since we are building on Next.js, it is recommended to deploy using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) so you can take advantage of the Open Graph Image Generator in the Advanced example.

Regardless of where you deploy, make sure you set up the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in the environment variables.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```
